# I want to remove some information from the original data that could point the neural network to the specific year...
# To avoid overfitting
# To do so i will remove the year as an information, and keep only the month and day
# also the value of the index could int to the year, so instead of the absolute value i will keep the 
# gain or loss over the previous day
